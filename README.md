# ipns-uploader-app

A small app to upload and save data on IPFS and getting a IPNS location. Typically could be used for NFT developers and much more

- Do you want to save your data on IPFS without the name(CID) changing?
- Are you tired of saving your NFT hosted images on an old dumb web2 based Apache or AWS server?

With this app you can create a single, stable IPNS address that points to the CID for the lastest version of that data just by using a peer ID.
